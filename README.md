# SC1015 Mini Project - _Binary Prediction of Singaporeans/PR Birth Rate_

This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which aims to identify whether the birth rate for Singaporeans/PR in Singapore will increase or decrease given several factors, using multi-variate linear regression and binary classification
